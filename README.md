**Wine Bar Monokai** is a dark color theme for Visual Studio Code that offers a unique and cozy aesthetic. Inspired by the warm, rustic feel of an old wooden bar serving high-quality red wine, this theme aims to make your coding experience more pleasant and visually appealing. It combines the classic Monokai highlighter with a distinctive brown-maroon color palette, creating a comfortable working environment with clear distinctions between your working area and functional elements of the workbench.

## Customize the theme
### Syntax color
If you want to customize the syntax color, follow the instruction [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme). I prepared some code sample of various languages in the repository to help testing the colors.

### Workbench color
Customizing the color of workbench element is a bit more tricky, as there is no straighforward way to find out the name of the element you want to change (if there is, please let me know!). In any case, the instruction is available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme#workbench-colors).
